---+!! Ip To User Mapping Plugin

%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

%TOC%

There are times when you need to auto-login specific computers automatically - search engine indexers, Wiki Kiosks,
special scripts, users that are not able to be created in your Enterprise LDAP for policy reasons or perhaps as a fallback if your centralised
User system is temporarily unavailable.

This plugin makes it possible for your wiki admin to associate an IP address with a foswiki user account - note that this comes with a risk - anyone with access to that 
computer will be logged in as that user.

Any users that are auto-authenticated by IP address, _should_ be put into a foswiki group to manage their permissions.

Also, please be careful to only give these mappings to ip addresses that are statically assigned.

---++ Preferences

Plugin preferences are set using =configure=.

an example setting:

<verbatim>
$Foswiki::cfg{IpToUserMappingPlugin}{Mapping} = {
    '192.168.1.220' => {login=>'one', wikiname=>'OneUser'},
    };
</verbatim>

When a request comes from a computer via the network interface 
(if that computer has more than one network card, it is likely to have more than one ip address), foswiki will
consider it logged in as use !OneUser - so you can create that topic in %USERSWEB% and set some preferences for that access. If the =one= user exists (by that login name) in the main user mapping system, the =wikiname= configure setting will be ignored.

For example, you might like to use the simpler =Set SKIN=plain= plain skin when indexing topics, so you only get hits on topic content.
